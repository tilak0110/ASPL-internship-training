# Indexes in MySQL

## Introduction
Indexes in MySQL are used to improve the performance of queries by allowing for faster retrieval of data. An index is a data structure that enhances the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table, at the cost of additional space and maintenance overhead.

## Why Use Indexes?
- **Speed up queries**: Searching for data is much faster.
- **Improve sorting and filtering**: Helps with `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and `WHERE` clauses.
- **Reduce I/O operations**: Avoids scanning the entire table for matching records.
- **Enforce uniqueness**: Ensures unique constraints on columns.

## Types of Indexes in MySQL

### 1. Primary Index
- Automatically created for `PRIMARY KEY` columns.
- Ensures unique and non-null values.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);
```

### 2. Unique Index
- Ensures all values in the indexed column(s) are unique.
- Allows `NULL` values (except when defined otherwise).

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON students(email);
```

### 3. Composite Index
- An index on multiple columns.
- Helps optimize queries filtering by multiple columns.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name_age ON students(name, age);
```

### 4. Full-Text Index
- Used for text-based searches (e.g., searching large text fields like `TEXT` or `VARCHAR`).
- Supports `MATCH() ... AGAINST()` syntax.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_description ON books(description);
```

### 5. Spatial Index
- Used for indexing spatial data types (e.g., `POINT`, `POLYGON`).
- Requires the `MyISAM` or `InnoDB` engine with spatial capabilities.

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE SPATIAL INDEX idx_location ON locations(geo_point);
```

### 6. Clustered Index
- The physical ordering of records follows the primary key.
- In MySQL, the `PRIMARY KEY` acts as a clustered index in `InnoDB`.

### 7. Non-Clustered Index
- Stores pointers to the actual data instead of the data itself.
- Separate from table storage.

## Managing Indexes

### Creating an Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON employees(lastname);
```

### Creating an Index with `ALTER TABLE`
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ADD INDEX idx_salary(salary);
```

### Removing an Index
```sql
DROP INDEX idx_lastname ON employees;
```

### Viewing Indexes
```sql
SHOW INDEXES FROM employees;
```

## When to Use Indexes?
- Frequently used columns in `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `JOIN` clauses.
- Large tables where query performance is a concern.
- Unique constraints to ensure data integrity.

## When Not to Use Indexes?
- Small tables (overhead may not be worth it).
- Columns that are frequently updated (indexes slow down updates/inserts).
- Columns with low cardinality (e.g., `GENDER` with only `M` and `F` values).

## Conclusion
Indexes are a powerful feature in MySQL that significantly boost query performance. However, they should be used wisely, as they can introduce additional storage costs and impact write performance. Proper indexing strategies can greatly optimize database efficiency.
