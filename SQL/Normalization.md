# **Database Normalization in MySQL**

## **Introduction**

Database Normalization is a systematic approach to designing a relational database to reduce redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and tables. The goal is to decompose larger tables into smaller ones while maintaining data integrity.

Normalization ensures that the database is efficient, scalable, and free from anomalies that can arise due to poor structuring. It follows a set of rules known as **normal forms**, where each normal form has specific criteria for eliminating redundancy and ensuring proper organization of data.

## **Why Normalization?**

Normalization is essential because:

- It **eliminates redundant data**, reducing storage requirements.
- It **ensures data consistency**, preventing anomalies and inconsistencies.
- It **prevents anomalies** (Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies).
- It **improves database efficiency** by minimizing disk space usage and improving indexing.
- It **enhances query performance**, making retrievals faster.
- It **ensures data integrity** and reduces errors, preventing incorrect data propagation.
- It **allows flexible and scalable database structures**, making it easier to accommodate changes.

## **Types of Anomalies (Before Normalization)**

### **1. Insertion Anomaly**

Occurs when data cannot be inserted into the database due to missing information. This happens when fields are dependent on other fields that must first exist before inserting new data.

#### **Example:**

| Student\_ID | Name | Course | Instructor |
| ----------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1           | John | Math   | Dr. Smith  |
| 2           | Sam  |        |            |

**Issue:** If a new student has not enrolled in any course, inserting their data is impossible without leaving `Course` and `Instructor` as NULL.

### **2. Update Anomaly**

Occurs when multiple rows store duplicate data, requiring multiple updates. If updates are inconsistent, it can lead to data inconsistencies.

#### **Example:**

| Student\_ID | Name | Course | Instructor |
| ----------- | ---- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1           | John | Math   | Dr. Smith  |
| 2           | Sam  | Math   | Dr. Smith  |

**Issue:** If `Dr. Smith` changes their name, we need to update multiple records, increasing the risk of errors if some records are left unchanged.

### **3. Deletion Anomaly**

Occurs when deleting data unintentionally removes useful information.

#### **Example:**

| Student\_ID | Name | Course  | Instructor |
| ----------- | ---- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1           | John | Math    | Dr. Smith  |
| 2           | Sam  | Physics | Dr. Brown  |

**Issue:** If we remove the last student enrolled in `Math`, we also lose information about `Dr. Smith`, even though they may still be associated with the university.

## **Normalization Forms (NF)**

Each normal form builds upon the previous one, ensuring a more structured database.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ First Normal Form (1NF)**

**Rules:**

1. Each column should contain **atomic values** (no multiple values in a single cell).
2. Each row should have a **unique identifier** (Primary Key).
3. No **repeating groups** or arrays.

### **Example (Before 1NF - Unnormalized Table)**

| Student\_ID | Name | Courses       |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------- |
| 1           | John | Math, Physics |
| 2           | Sam  | Chemistry     |

**Issue:**

- The `Courses` column contains **multiple values**.

### **Solution (After 1NF)**

| Student\_ID | Name | Course    |
| ----------- | ---- | --------- |
| 1           | John | Math      |
| 1           | John | Physics   |
| 2           | Sam  | Chemistry |

Now, each column contains atomic values, and there are no repeating groups.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Second Normal Form (2NF)**

**Rules:**

1. The table **must be in 1NF**.
2. No **Partial Dependency** (Every non-key column must depend on the whole primary key, not just part of it).

### **Example (Before 2NF)**

| Student\_ID | Course\_ID | Student\_Name | Course\_Name |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | C101       | John          | Math         |
| 2           | C102       | Sam           | Chemistry    |

**Issue:**

- `Student_Name` depends only on `Student_ID`.
- `Course_Name` depends only on `Course_ID`.
- This is **Partial Dependency**.

### **Solution (After 2NF)**

#### **Student Table**

| Student\_ID | Student\_Name |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| 1           | John          |
| 2           | Sam           |

#### **Course Table**

| Course\_ID | Course\_Name |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| C101       | Math         |
| C102       | Chemistry    |

#### **Student\_Course Table**

| Student\_ID | Course\_ID |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| 1           | C101       |
| 2           | C102       |

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Third Normal Form (3NF)**

**Rules:**

1. The table **must be in 2NF**.
2. No **Transitive Dependency** (A non-key column must not depend on another non-key column).

### **Example (Before 3NF)**

| Student\_ID | Student\_Name | Course\_ID | Course\_Name | Instructor |
| ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 1           | John          | C101       | Math         | Dr. Smith  |
| 2           | Sam           | C102       | Chemistry    | Dr. Brown  |

**Issue:**

- `Instructor` depends on `Course_Name`, which is not a primary key.

### **Solution (After 3NF)**

#### **Course Table**

| Course\_ID | Course\_Name |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| C101       | Math         |
| C102       | Chemistry    |

#### **Instructor Table**

| Course\_ID | Instructor |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| C101       | Dr. Smith  |
| C102       | Dr. Brown  |

| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **1NF**     | No duplicate columns, atomic values          |
